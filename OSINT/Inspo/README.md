## Difficulty: Medium
## Tools: Google Reverse Image Search, Google Maps
## Description:
We believe that the North Torbians are heavily influenced by North Korean developments and wish to match them. We have suspicions that Juche Jaguar will try to build out similar spaces to ones in these pictures. Can you find the coordinates of where these pictures were taken?
The flag is any valid decimal degree coordinate notation within a 500m radius of the building. The flag is in the following format: C1{XX.XXX,XX.XXX}
For example, the White House would be at decimal degree notion of 38.897, -77.036. The flag for the White House would be: C1{38.897,-77.036}
Note that this flag is a regex match for any valid coordinate within the 500m radius.
## Solve:
The thing about OSINT, and perhaps a lot of other challenges, is that there are lots of ways to solve it. Different people may have different approaches and different resources, using different tools. In this writeup is how I arrive at my solution, but it is in no way the only solution. 
- After downloading the two images, I first reverse search the computer club picture
